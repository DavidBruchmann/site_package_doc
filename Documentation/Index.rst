The development of a website can be approached in several ways. Standard websites usually consist of HTML documents, which have texts, images, videos, styles, etc. embedded. The enterprise content management system *TYPO3 CMS* provides a clean separation between design, content and functionality of a website and allows developers/integrators to add simple as well as sophisticated functions to the system.

This tutorial describes the steps required to turn a design template (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, etc.) into a fully working website powered by TYPO3 CMS. The main target audience are web developers and integrators who have not worked with TYPO3 CMS before and developers (even without programming knowledge) who have experience with older versions of TYPO3 CMS already and who would like to learn a possibly new approach to set up a website.

This tutorial and all screenshots were created using **TYPO3 CMS version 8.2**.
