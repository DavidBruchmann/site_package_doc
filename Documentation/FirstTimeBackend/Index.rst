The fact that she has access to the "**ADMIN TOOLS**" and the function "**WEB** > **Templates**" in the *module menu* left-hand-side proves that she has appropriate access privileges ("administrator access").


Hardening the Security
----------------------

Angela takes security seriously and knows that she should change the password of her account straight away. She finds the appropriate function in her **User Settings** as she clicked on her user name at the top. Here, Angela also finds input fields for her name and email address.

As a second step, Angela also changes the Install Tool password (**Install Tool** > **Important actions** > Change install tool password).


.. note::

    To find out more about best practise security, see the official :ref:`Security Guide <t3security:start>` for further details.


Basic Backend Functions
-----------------------

After getting a little bit familiar with the backend and its functions and features, Angela realises that the most important points for her first TYPO3 project seem to be the following modules:

* **WEB** > **Page** module (shows the page tree, which currently contains one entry only)
* **FILE** > **Filelist** module (which obviously enables her to upload files)
* **ADMIN TOOLS** > **Extensions** module (which lists a number of *extensions*)
